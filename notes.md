- empowers developer
- everyone speaks the same language
- You have a single point of success of failure
- Removes dupplication

#### Dupplication
- dupplication leads to fragmentation which leads to stop sharing things.
- Code base becomes confusing
- Things get out of date
- a11y = accessibility

#### How did Adobe scale
- Componentizing content
- All content was put into a content type
- This enabled to have JSON tests and schema tests
